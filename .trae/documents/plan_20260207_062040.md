I have researched competitive apps (Co-Star, The Pattern, Nebula) and analyzed your current codebase. I propose a comprehensive "Today's Guidance" page that combines your existing astrological engines with new engagement features like Tarot, Affirmations, and Mood Tracking.

### **1. Competitive Analysis & Strategy**
| Feature | Competitor Standard | Your New Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Presentation** | Minimalist text (Co-Star) or Chat (Sanctuary) | **"Cosmic Feed"**: A visually rich, card-based scrolling feed blending data with spiritual insights. |
| **Content** | Generic horoscopes | **Hyper-Personalized**: Synthesizes Transits + Dasha + Panchang (using your existing backend engines). |
| **Engagement** | Push notifications | **Ritual Gamification**: Daily streaks, mood logging, and "unlockable" daily tarot cards. |

### **2. Proposed "Today's Guidance" Page Structure**
I will build a new page `TodaysGuidance.tsx` featuring:

*   **Header**: "The Vibe" – A dynamic, color-coded summary (e.g., "Cautionary Red" or "Growth Green") based on your Moon Transit logic.
*   **Daily Ritual Stack** (Interactive Cards):
    *   🎴 **Tarot of the Day**: A new feature where users "tap to reveal" a card for spiritual guidance.
    *   ✨ **Daily Affirmation**: Personalized positive reinforcement.
    *   📅 **Panchang Snapshot**: Tithi, Nakshatra, and "Golden Window" (Abhijit Muhurta).
*   **Mood Tracker**: A slider/emoji interface to log daily emotional states (stored locally for privacy/speed).
*   **Planetary Insights**: A visual breakdown of "Power Planets" influencing the user today (from `dailyAnalysis.ts`).

### **3. Implementation Plan**
**Phase 1: Core Logic & Assets (Frontend)**
*   Create `tarotData.ts`: A lightweight database of 78 tarot cards with keywords.
*   Create `affirmationData.ts`: A curated list of 50+ affirmations.
*   Update `dailyAnalysis.ts`: Enhance the "Vibe" algorithm to return a color theme/score.

**Phase 2: UI Construction**
*   Build `TodaysGuidance.tsx` using a mobile-responsive "Feed" layout.
*   Implement animations (Framer Motion or CSS) for card flips and reveals.
*   Integrate `DailyHoroscope` logic to fetch real-time planetary data.

**Phase 3: Engagement Features**
*   Implement `StreakTracker`: Simple local-storage based logic to track consecutive daily visits.
*   Implement `MoodLogger`: Interactive component to save daily mood.

**Phase 4: Integration**
*   Add to Main Navigation (`App.tsx`).
*   Link from User Dashboard.

This plan leverages your existing backend engines (`daily_horoscope_engine`) while adding the "sticky" frontend features found in top-tier apps.
