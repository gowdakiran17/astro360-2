I have carefully re-reviewed `/Users/kiran/Desktop/astro360-2/Today's Guidance page.md` and identified the **Comprehensive "Relationship & Interactions" Section** detailed at the end of the file (lines 1129+). This is a critical addition that transforms the social guidance into a deep, multi-tabbed dashboard.

I will implement the **Full V3 Upgrade** with a specific focus on this detailed Interaction Forecast system.

### Phase 1: Advanced Data Synthesis (The "Brain")
I will update `src/services/guidance.ts` to generate the deep `interactionForecast` structure. Since the backend provides general horoscopes, I will implement an intelligent **Astrological Derivation Engine** on the frontend to map planetary influences to specific relationships:
- **Sun/Saturn status** → Boss/Authority figures (Work Tab)
- **Mercury status** → Colleagues/Communication (Work Tab)
- **Venus/Mars status** → Romantic Partners (Romantic Tab)
- **Moon status** → Family/Mother (Family Tab)
- **Jupiter status** → Mentors/Advisors (Professional Tab)

This ensures the detailed advice (e.g., "Avoid complaining to your boss") is historically consistent with the user's actual chart data.

### Phase 2: The "Interaction Forecast" Engine
I will build the complex `InteractionForecastSection` as specified in the appendix:
- **Tabs:** Romantic, Work, Family, Professional, Financial, Health.
- **Sub-categories:** Manager, Colleagues, Interviews, Clients, Parents, Siblings, etc.
- **Rich UI Cards:** Implementing the exact `InteractionCard` design with:
  - Status Pills & Scores
  - "Power Moves" & "Conversation Starters"
  - Expandable "Specific Scenarios"
  - Connection Metrics (Emotional/Physical/Mental graphs)

### Phase 3: Complete V3 Page Architecture
I will build the remaining missing sections from the main prompt:
- **Timeline Tabs:** `TimelineTabs.tsx` (Today/Tomorrow/Week).
- **Daily Tools:** `DailyTarotCard`, `DailyAffirmation`, `DailyRemedy`, `GuidedMeditation`.
- **Deep Dive:** `NakshatraWisdom`, `PanchangDetails`, `CurrentDasha`, `TransitAlerts`.
- **Engagement:** `MoodTracker`, `DailyChallenge`, `LuckyElements`.

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish
- Update `TodaysGuidance.tsx` to house this new massive structure.
- Ensure the "Dark Cosmic Theme" is applied consistently across all new deep-dive sections.
- Verify that the "Interaction Forecast" feels responsive and fluid on mobile.
