{"answer":"# 📈 Timing Analysis\n\nHere's a detailed astrological timing analysis based on your natal chart and relevant astrological principles. I'll focus on identifying favorable and challenging periods to help you make informed decisions.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Timing Insights\n\nAccording to Prasna Marga, the strength of the planets and their transits influence outcomes. The current planetary positions suggest a period of mixed influences, requiring careful planning and execution.\n\nFavorable periods often involve transits of benefic planets (Jupiter, Venus, well-placed Mercury) over key houses or natal planets.
