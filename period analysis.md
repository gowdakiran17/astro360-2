THIS MONTH TAB
Month Overview Card

Month: "November 2026"
Overall score: 72/100

Challenging week: Week 3 (Nov 16-22) - 64/100
Peak day: Nov 12 (91/100)
Lowest day: Nov 19 (48/100)

AI Monthly Summary (Detailed Narrative):
"November 2026 presents a generally positive month with scores ranging from 48-91/100. The month begins with moderate energy as you adjust to Saturn Antardasha's more serious tone. Week 2 brings excellent opportunities, particularly November 12th which stands out as the month's best day for major decisions and new initiatives.
Mid-month (Nov 16-22) requires extra patience as several challenging transits coincide with difficult muhurtas. This is a period for consolidation rather than expansion. Avoid major commitments during Nov 18-20 if possible.
The final week (Nov 23-30) recovers nicely with scores returning to the 70-80 range. This is excellent for completing projects started earlier in the month and for financial matters.
Overall, November supports: career advancement, spiritual practices, relationship deepening, and moderate financial gains. Challenges lie in: health management (6th house weak), domestic peace (4th house challenged), and maintaining patience during delays.
Key Dates:
- Best days: Nov 12, 7, 25, 28
